# Albanian Virus - A Funny and Educational Program

**Warning**: This is a harmless and educational program designed for fun. It simulates a virus alert but does not cause any harm to your computer. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic concepts of Java and how a message dialog can be displayed to the user.

## Overview

The **Albanian Virus** is a playful program created for educational purposes. It simulates the behavior of a computer virus that displays a humorous message to the user. It asks the user to delete one of their important files (which is entirely up to the user) and forwards the program to other users.

### Features:
- **Funny and harmless alert**: It shows an error message in a dialog box.
- **Educational**: Learn how to use JOptionPane and create a simple GUI-based program.
- **No harm to your system**: It doesn't delete, modify, or harm any files on your computer.

## How it works:

When you run the program, it shows a dialog box with the following message:

> "Hi, I am Albanian virus. But because of poor technology in my country unfortunately I am not able to harm your computer.
> 
> Please be so kind to delete one of your important files yourself and then forward me to other users.
> 
> Many thanks for your cooperation.
> 
> Best regards, Albanian virus."

After displaying this message, the program ends and does not affect your system in any way.
